            <p>"Beauty Provider" means a provider of beauty services, including any hairstylists or makeup artists carrying out services in accordance with the Legislation.</p>
            <p>"NowBeauty" shall mean NowBeauty Limited, a private limited liability company incorporated and registered in England and Wales with company number 10566352, whose registered office is at 40 Bloomsbury Way, London WC1A 2SE, UK.</p>
            <p>"NowBeauty App" means the software application and related services provided by NowBeauty Ltd to you pursuant to these terms and conditions</p>
            <p>"Website" shall mean&nbsp;
                <a href="https://nowbeautyapp.com">www.nowbeautyapp.com</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>2. PART 1- THE PROVISION OF BOOKING SERVICES BY NOWBEAUTY
</strong>
            </p>
            <p>NowBeauty provides to you certain booking services (the "Booking Services"). The Booking Services include:</p>
            <p>1. Accepting bookings requested by you through NowBeauty App &amp; Website but without prejudice to NowBeauty&rsquo;s rights and its sole and absolute discretion to decline any such request and/or cancel an accepted booking;</p>
            <p>2. Identifying suitable Beauty Providers;</p>
            <p>3. Keeping records of bookings;</p>
            <p>4. Remotely monitoring services booked using the NowBeauty App &amp; Website;</p>
            <p>5. Receiving and dealing with feedback, questions and complaints relating to bookings accepted by NowBeauty, which may be made by email to hello@nowbeautyapp.com. You are encouraged to provide your feedback if any of the beauty services provided
                to you by a beauty Provider do not conform to your expectations; and in each case in accordance with any relevant provisions of the Legislation. Pursuant to, and for the purposes of the Legislation, NowBeauty accepts bookings at its registered
                address and/or operating centres and is subject to all statutory and regulatory obligations and liabilities with respect to that activity.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>3. YOUR BEAUTY SERVICES CONTRACT WITH A BEAUTY PROVIDER
</strong>
            </p>
            <p>NowBeauty is not a Beauty Provider and does not provide any beauty services. Beauty services are provided to you under a contract (the "Beauty Services Contract") between you and the Beauty Provider that is identified to you in the booking
                confirmation provided by NowBeauty.</p>
            <p>NowBeauty is not a party to the Beauty Services Contract and acts as a disclosed agent for the Beauty Provider in communicating the Beauty Provider's agreement to enter into the Beauty Services Contract.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>4. PAYMENT
</strong>
            </p>
            <p>The Booking Services are provided by NowBeauty to you free of charge. NowBeauty reserves the right to introduce a fee for the provision of the Booking Services. If NowBeauty decides to introduce such a fee, it will inform you accordingly and
                allow you to either continue or terminate your access to the Booking Services through the NowBeauty App at your option. The rates that apply for the beauty services provided by the Beauty Provider can be found on the Website and through
                the NowBeauty App. These may be modified or updated from time to time. It is your responsibility to remain informed about the current rates for the beauty services.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
</strong>
            </p>
            <p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, NowBeauty will not be liable to you in any way (whether such liability arises in contract (by way of indemnity or otherwise), tort (including negligence) misrepresentation, breach of statutory duty,
                restitution or otherwise) for: any theft or loss of your or any other person's property in connection with the Booking Services or any booking accepted by NowBeauty;</p>
            <p>a. any booking that has not been accepted;</p>
            <p>b. any loss, damage, costs, expenses or liability suffered by anyone other than you in connection with your use of the NowBeauty App and Website;</p>
            <p>c. any losses that could not reasonably be expected to result from our negligence or breach of these Terms and Conditions;</p>
            <p>d. any loss relating to your business or the business of your employer or any other person;</p>
            <p>e. any loss of profits, loss of revenue, loss of opportunity, loss of business or employment (whether or not such loss could be reasonably expected to flow from our negligence or breach of these Terms and Conditions); or</p>
            <p>f. any other loss, damage, costs, expenses or liability that you suffer in connection with the Booking Services, save to the extent that NowBeauty fails to perform its obligations to you to the standard of a diligent and professional provider
                of the relevant services.</p>
            <p>g. If NowBeauty is liable to you in connection with the Booking Services, its liability will be limited to an amount equal to &pound;250 in aggregate.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>6. APPLICABLE LAW
</strong>
            </p>
            <p>The Booking Services and the Booking Service Terms set out in this section, and all non-contractual obligations arising in any way whatsoever out of or in connection with the Booking Service Terms shall be governed by, construed and take effect
                in accordance with the laws of England and Wales.</p>
            <p>Any dispute, claim or matter of difference arising out of or relating to the Booking Services or Booking Service Terms is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Part 2 &ndash; TERMS OF USE</h3>
            <p>These Terms of Use (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) apply to your visit to and your use of the Website and the NowBeauty App as well as to all other information, recommendations and/or services provided to you on or through the Website and the NowBeauty
                App, but for the avoidance of doubt these User Terms do not apply to the Booking Services defined and described in Part 1 above. However, defined terms used in this Part 2 shall have the meaning given in Part 1 unless otherwise specified.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>1. Contractual Relationship</strong>
            </p>
            <p>These Terms in Part 2 govern the access or use by you, an individual, from within any country in the world of applications (including the NowBeauty App), websites, content, products, and services (the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;) made available
                by NowBeauty, a private limited liability company established in the United Kingdom, having its offices at 40 Bloomsbury Way, London WC1A 2SE, UK(&ldquo;NowBeauty&rdquo;).</p>
            <p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES.</p>
            <p>Your access and use of the Services constitutes your agreement to be bound by these Terms, which establishes a contractual relationship between you and NowBeauty. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Services.
                These Terms expressly supersede prior agreements or arrangements with you. NowBeauty may terminate these Terms or any Services with respect to you, or generally cease offering or deny access to the Services or any portion thereof, at any
                time for any reason. NowBeauty will provide you with as much notice as it reasonably can of such termination, cessation or denial, being at least 24 hours notice. However, NowBeauty reserves the right to terminate these Terms or any Services
                with respect to you, or generally cease offering or deny access to the Services or any portion thereof, immediately at any time without notice if (i) you are in breach of these Terms, (ii) it is impractical to give such notice in the circumstances,
                or (iii) in NowBeauty&rsquo;s opinion, any delay in such termination would expose NowBeauty or a third party to significant risk of harm or damage.</p>
            <p>Supplemental terms may apply to certain Services, such as policies for a particular event, activity or promotion, and such supplemental terms will be disclosed to you in connection with the applicable Services. Supplemental terms are in addition
                to, and shall be deemed a part of, the Terms for the purposes of the applicable Services. Supplemental terms shall prevail over these Terms in the event of a conflict with respect to the applicable Services.</p>
            <p>NowBeauty may amend the Terms related to the Services from time to time. Amendments will be effective upon NowBeauty&rsquo;s posting of such updated Terms at this location or the amended policies or supplemental terms on the applicable Service.
                Your continued access or use of the Services after such posting constitutes your consent to be bound by the Terms, as amended.
            </p>
            <p>Our collection and use of personal information in connection with the Services is as provided in NowBeauty&rsquo;s Privacy and Cookie Policy.</p>
            <p>NowBeauty may provide to a claims processor or an insurer any necessary information (including your contact information) if there is a complaint, dispute or conflict, which may include an accident, involving you and a Third Party Provider
                (including a Beauty Provider) and such information or data is necessary to resolve the complaint, dispute or conflict.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>2. The Services</strong>
            </p>
            <p>The Services constitute a technology platform that enables users of NowBeauty&rsquo;s mobile applications or websites provided as part of the Services (each, an &ldquo;Application&rdquo;) to pre-book and schedule beauty services and/or other
                services with independent third party providers of such services, including independent third party transportation providers (including Beauty Providers as defined in Part 1). Unless otherwise agreed by NowBeauty in a separate written
                agreement with you, the Services are made available solely for your personal, non-commercial use. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NOWBEAUTY DOES NOT PROVIDE BEAUTY SERVICES, OR OR FUNCTION AS A BEAUTY PROVIDER AND THAT ALL SUCH SERVICES ARE PROVIDED
                BY INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY CONTRACTORS WHO ARE NOT EMPLOYED BY NOWBEAUTY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>License</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms, NowBeauty grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, revocable, non-transferable license to: (i) access and use the Applications on your personal device solely in connection with your
                use of the Services; and (ii) access and use any content, information and related materials that may be made available through the Services, in each case solely for your personal, non-commercial use. Any rights not expressly granted herein
                are reserved by NowBeauty and NowBeauty&rsquo;s licensors.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Restrictions</strong>
            </p>
            <p>You may not: (i) remove any copyright, trademark or other proprietary notices from any portion of the Services; (ii) reproduce, modify, prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, license, lease, sell, resell, transfer, publicly display,
                publicly perform, transmit, stream, broadcast or otherwise exploit the Services except as expressly permitted by NowBeauty; (iii) decompile, reverse engineer or disassemble the Services except as may be permitted by applicable law; (iv)
                link to, mirror or frame any portion of the Services; (v) cause or launch any programs or scripts for the purpose of scraping, indexing, surveying, or otherwise data mining any portion of the Services or unduly burdening or hindering the
                operation and/or functionality of any aspect of the Services; or (vi) attempt to gain unauthorized access to or impair any aspect of the Services or its related systems or networks.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Third Party Services and Content</strong>
            </p>
            <p>The Services may be made available or accessed in connection with third party services and content (including advertising) that NowBeauty does not control. You acknowledge that different terms of use and privacy policies may apply to your
                use of such third party services and content. NowBeauty does not endorse such third party services and content and in no event shall NowBeauty be responsible or liable for any products or services of such third party providers. Additionally,
                Apple Inc., Google, Inc., Microsoft Corporation or BlackBerry Limited and/or their applicable international subsidiaries and affiliates will be third-party beneficiaries to this contract if you access the Services using Applications developed
                for Apple iOS, Android, Microsoft Windows, or Blackberry-powered mobile devices, respectively. These third party beneficiaries are not parties to this contract and are not responsible for the provision or support of the Services in any
                manner. Your access to the Services using these devices is subject to terms set forth in the applicable third party beneficiary&rsquo;s terms of service.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Ownership</strong>
            </p>
            <p>The Services and all rights therein are and shall remain NowBeauty&rsquo;s property or the property of NowBeauty&rsquo;s licensors. Neither these Terms nor your use of the Services convey or grant to you any rights: (i) in or related to the
                Services except for the limited license granted above; or (ii) to use or reference in any manner NowBeauty&rsquo;s company names, logos, product and service names, trademarks or services marks or those of NowBeauty&rsquo;s licensors.</p>

                <strong>3. Your Use of the Services</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>User Accounts</strong>
            </p>
            <p>In order to use most aspects of the Services, you must register for and maintain an active personal user Services account (&ldquo;Account&rdquo;). You must be at least 18 years of age, or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction (if
                different than 18), to obtain an Account. Account registration requires you to submit to NowBeauty certain personal information, such as your name, address, mobile phone number and age, as well as at least one valid payment method (either
                a credit card or accepted payment partner). You agree to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date information in your Account. Your failure to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date Account information, including having an invalid
                or expired payment method on file, may result in your inability to access and use the Services or NowBeauty&rsquo;s termination of this Agreement with you. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Account, and you agree
                to maintain the security and secrecy of your Account username and password at all times. Unless otherwise permitted by NowBeauty in writing, you may only possess one Account.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>User Requirements and Conduct</strong>
            </p>
            <p>The Service is not available for use by persons under the age of 18. You may not authorize third parties to use your Account, and you may not allow persons under the age of 18 to receive beauty services, or services from Third Party Providers
                unless they are accompanied by you. You may not assign or otherwise transfer your Account to any other person or entity. You agree to comply with all applicable laws when using the Services, and you may only use the Services for lawful
                purposes. You will not, in your use of the Services, cause nuisance, annoyance, inconvenience, or property damage, whether to the Third Party Provider or any other party. In certain instances you may be asked to provide proof of identity
                to access or use the Services, and you agree that you may be denied access to or use of the Services if you refuse to provide proof of identity.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Text Messaging</strong>
            </p>
            <p>By creating an Account, you agree that the Services may send you text (SMS) messages as part of the normal business operation of your use of the Services. You may opt-out of receiving text (SMS) messages from NowBeauty at any time by unsubscibing
                or sending us an email at hello@nowbeautyapp.com. You acknowledge that opting out of receiving text (SMS) messages may impact your use of the Services.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Promotional Codes</strong>
            </p>
            <p>NowBeauty may, in NowBeauty&rsquo;s sole discretion, create promotional codes that may be redeemed for Account credit, or other features or benefits related to the Services and/or a Third Party Provider&rsquo;s services, subject to any additional
                terms that NowBeauty establishes on a per promotional code basis (&ldquo; Promo Codes&rdquo;). You agree that Promo Codes: (i) must be used for the intended audience and purpose, and in a lawful manner; (ii) may not be duplicated, sold
                or transferred in any manner, or made available to the general public (whether posted to a public forum or otherwise), unless expressly permitted by NowBeauty; (iii) may be disabled by NowBeauty at any time for any reason without liability
                to NowBeauty; (iv) may only be used pursuant to the specific terms that NowBeauty establishes for such Promo Code; (v) are not valid for cash; and (vi) may expire prior to your use. NowBeauty reserves the right to withhold or deduct credits
                or other features or benefits obtained through the use of Promo Codes by you or any other user in the event that NowBeauty determines or believes that the use or redemption of the Promo Code was in error, fraudulent, illegal, or in violation
                of the applicable Promo Code terms or these Terms.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Network Access and Devices</strong>
            </p>
            <p>You are responsible for obtaining the data network access necessary to use the Services. Your mobile network&rsquo;s data and messaging rates and fees may apply if you access or use the Services from a wireless-enabled device and you shall
                be responsible for such rates and fees. You are responsible for acquiring and updating compatible hardware or devices necessary to access and use the Services and Applications and any updates thereto. NowBeauty does not guarantee that
                the Services, or any portion thereof, will function on any particular hardware or devices. In addition, the Services may be subject to malfunctions and delays inherent in the use of the Internet and electronic communications.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>4. Payment</strong>
            </p>
            <p>You understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you for the services or goods you receive from a Third Party Provider (&ldquo;Charges&rdquo;). After you have received services or goods obtained through your use of the Services,
                NowBeauty will facilitate your payment of the applicable Charges on behalf of the Third Party Provider as disclosed payment collection agent for the Third Party Provider (as Principal). Payment of the Charges in such manner shall be considered
                the same as payment made directly by you to the Third Party Provider. Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by NowBeauty. You
                retain the right to request lower Charges from a Third Party Provider for services or goods received by you from such Third Party Provider at the time you receive such services or goods. NowBeauty will respond accordingly to any request
                from a Third Party Provider to modify the Charges for a particular service or good.</p>
            <p>All Charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated as soon as practicable by NowBeauty using the preferred payment method designated in your Account, after which NowBeauty will send you a receipt by email. If your primary Account
                payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that NowBeauty may, as the Third Party Provider&rsquo;s disclosed payment collection agent, use a secondary payment method in your Account,
                if available.</p>
            <p>As between you and NowBeauty, NowBeauty reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise Charges for any or all services or goods obtained through the use of the Services at any time in NowBeauty&rsquo;s sole discretion. Further, you
                acknowledge and agree that Charges applicable in certain geographical areas may increase substantially during times of high demand. NowBeauty will use reasonable efforts to inform you of Charges that may apply, provided that you will be
                responsible for Charges incurred under your Account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof. NowBeauty may from time to time provide certain users with promotional offers and discounts that may result in different
                amounts charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained through the use of the Services, and you agree that such promotional offers and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services
                or the Charges applied to you. You may elect to cancel your request for services or goods from a Third Party Provider at any time prior to such Third Party Provider&rsquo;s arrival, in which case you may be charged a cancellation fee.
                Please refer to our FAQ for more details on NowBeauty&rsquo;s cancellation policy.</p>
            <p>.</p>
            <p>This payment structure is intended to fully compensate the Third Party Provider for the services or goods provided. NowBeauty does not designate any portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to the Third Party Provider. You understand and
                agree that, while you are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity to any Third Party Provider who provides you with services or goods obtained through the Service, you are under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are voluntary.
                After you have received services or goods obtained through the Service, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback about your Third Party Provider.</p>

            <p>NOWBEAUTY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA, PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE RELATED TO, IN CONNECTION WITH, OR OTHERWISE RESULTING FROM
                ANY USE OF THE SERVICES, EVEN IF NOWBEAUTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. NOWBEAUTY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, LIABILITY OR LOSSES ARISING OUT OF: (i) YOUR USE OF OR RELIANCE ON THE SERVICES OR YOUR INABILITY
                TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; OR (ii) ANY TRANSACTION OR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND ANY THIRD PARTY PROVIDER, EVEN IF NOWBEAUTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. NOWBEAUTY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DELAY OR FAILURE

                POUNDS (&pound;500).</p>
            <p>NOWBEAUTY&rsquo;S SERVICES MAY BE USED BY YOU TO REQUEST AND SCHEDULE BEAUTY SERVICES, GOODS, OR OTHER SERVICES WITH THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS, BUT YOU AGREE THAT NOWBEAUTY HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY TO YOU RELATED TO ANY BEAUTY SERVICES,
                GOODS, OR OTHER SERVICES PROVIDED TO YOU BY THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS.</p>

            </p>
            <p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms in whole or in part without NowBeauty&rsquo;s prior written approval. You give your approval to NowBeauty for it to assign or transfer these Terms in whole or in part, including to: (i) a subsidiary
                or affiliate; (ii) an acquirer of NowBeauty&rsquo;s equity, business or assets; or (iii) a successor by merger. No joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship exists between you, NowBeauty or any Third Party Provider

            <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, under any law, such provision or part thereof shall to that extent be deemed not to form part of these Terms but the legality, validity and
                enforceability of the other provisions in these Terms shall not be affected. In that event, the parties shall replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or part thereof with a provision or part thereof that is legal, valid
                and enforceable and that has, to the greatest extent possible, a similar effect as the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or part thereof, given the contents and purpose of these Terms. These Terms constitute the entire agreement
                and understanding of the parties with respect to its subject matter and replaces and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or undertakings regarding such subject matter.</p>
